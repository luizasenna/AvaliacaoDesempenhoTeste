###Laravel 5.2

####Routes
Your routes need to be in the `web` routes group, otherwise it will not be able to use the session storage:

```
Route::group(['middleware' => ['web']], function () {

  Route::get('/auth0/callback', '\Auth0\Login\Auth0Controller@callback');

  Route::get('/', function () {

    if (Auth::check()) dd('LOGGED IN',Auth::user());

    return view('welcome');

  });
});
```

####Auth setup

In your `config/auth.php` file update the providers to use the `auth0` driver:

```
...
    'providers' => [
        'users' => [
            'driver' => 'auth0',
        ],
    ],
...
```
